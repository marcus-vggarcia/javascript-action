This is particularly useful for charges made after a free trial. The verification can be done in two ways:  Special verification transaction with no amount charged (Zero Dollar Transaction);Charge authorization of a unitary amount in local currency followed by a cancellation (the authorization will never be captured) (Ghost Authorization); infoEBANX will decide which method will be used according to availability. The first method depends on the support of acquirers and issuers. If it's not available, the second one is used.  Make sure you have the necessary fields You will need to provide the following fields to perform a card verification: Parameter Description integration_key Your unique and secret integration key. payment_type_code The card transaction type to verify. It can be &quot;creditcard&quot; or &quot;debitcard&quot;. country The two-letter country of the transaction. The available countries for now are &quot;br&quot; (Brazil), &quot;co&quot; (Colombia) and &quot;cl&quot; (Chile). device_id The unique identification of a customer&#x2019;s device. card.card_number The card number. card.card_name The cardholder name, as written in the plastic. card.card_due_date The card valid thru date (formatted as mm/yyyy). card.card_cvv The card verification value (CVV, CVV2 or CVC). Verify the card using the /ws/verifycard end-point Call the /ws/verifycard, passing the information collected in the previous step.

In case it has password protection, please send us the credentials as well.

By requiring customers’ access to his or hers app and account, this payment method reduces fraudulent chargebacks. On top of that, the checkout flow is easier: users don’t have to fill out credit card forms since all that information is already saved on their chosen wallets and used automatically.  infoSome e-wallets like Nequi does not allow the payment with credit or debit cards, just with balance. Some wallets also allow payment with balance, meaning clients can top up with Boleto Bancário or a simple wire transfer from their traditional bank account. "

      "content":"3D Secure, or 3DS, is a technical standard that adds a layer of security in online credit and debit card transactions, protecting the buyer's against unauthorised use. During the checkout process, if the cardholder is enrolled in 3D Secure, the issuing bank will decide whether the cardholder's identity can be verified using data supplied regarding the cardholder and their device, or if an additional authentication process is necessary. If additional authentication is necessary, a process provided by the issuing bank will begin to verify the cardholder’s identity via SMS one-time passcode, the issuing bank's mobile app, biometric methods, or other means. One of the main advantages of the protocol is the shift in liability of fraudulent chargebacks. If the transaction was authenticated, the liability of the transaction shifts from the merchant to the issuer. Unlike the 3DS 1.0, 3DS 2.0 simplifies the payment process by providing a larger set of cardholder information to the issuer, allowing for improved risk assessment and the ability to skip authentication challenge processes altogether for low risk transactions, leading to lower abandonment rates and better user experience.

Live Integration Key Once you have completed the process of integration with EBANX, you will receive a unique live mode key which will allow you to operate with our services; it is essential to keep all the information safe and not exposed. Live Public Integration Key&#xA0; General live mode key. Just like the Sandbox Public Integration Key, you can do a token operation using this key instead of the integration key when the request is from the client of your customer (browser, app, etc.). By doing this, you do not have to deal directly with the credit card information of your customer. EBANX Sandbox Mark or unmark the box to go into sandbox mode and live. EBANX Sandbox is a testing environment that mimics the live environment. Use it to make payments requirements to see how your eCommerce processes them. Debug Log Mark or unmark the box to choose to record all errors that occur when executing a transaction.  "
